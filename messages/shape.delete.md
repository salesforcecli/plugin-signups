# summary

Delete all org shapes for a target org.

# description

A source org can have only one active org shape. If you try to create an org shape for a source org that already has one, the previous shape is marked inactive and replaced by a new active shape. If you donâ€™t want to create scratch orgs based on this shape, you can delete the org shape.

# examples

- Delete all org shapes for the source org with alias SourceOrg:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --target-org SourceOrg
