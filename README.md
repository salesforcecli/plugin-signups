## Learn about the plugin-signups

Salesforce CLI plugins are based on the [oclif plugin framework](https://oclif.io/docs/introduction). Read the [plugin developer guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_plugins.meta/sfdx_cli_plugins/cli_plugins_architecture_sf_cli.htm) to learn about Salesforce CLI plugin development.

This repository contains a lot of additional scripts and tools to help with general Salesforce node development and enforce coding standards. You should familiarize yourself with some of the [node developer packages](https://github.com/forcedotcom/sfdx-dev-packages/) used by Salesforce. There is also a default circleci config using the [release management orb](https://github.com/forcedotcom/npm-release-management-orb) standards.

Additionally, there are some additional tests that the Salesforce CLI will enforce if this plugin is ever bundled with the CLI. These test are included by default under the `posttest` script and it is recommended to keep these tests active in your plugin, regardless if you plan to have it bundled.

# Everything past here is only a suggestion as to what should be in your specific plugin's description

This plugin is bundled with the [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli). For more information on the CLI, read the [getting started guide](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_intro.htm).

We always recommend using the latest version of these commands bundled with the CLI, however, you can install a specific version or tag if needed.

## Install

```bash
sfdx plugins:install signups@x.y.z
```

## Issues

Please report any issues at https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues

## Contributing

1. Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Create a new issue before starting your project so that we can keep track of
   what you are trying to add/fix. That way, we can also offer suggestions or
   let you know if there is already an effort in progress.
3. Fork this repository.
4. [Build the plugin locally](#build)
5. Create a _topic_ branch in your fork. Note, this step is recommended but technically not required if contributing using a fork.
6. Edit the code in your fork.
7. Write appropriate tests for your changes. Try to achieve at least 95% code coverage on any new code. No pull request will be accepted without unit tests.
8. Sign CLA (see [CLA](#cla) below).
9. Send us a pull request when you are done. We'll review your code, suggest any needed changes, and merge it in.

### CLA

External contributors will be required to sign a Contributor's License
Agreement. You can do so by going to https://cla.salesforce.com/sign-cla.

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-signups

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev force:org:shape
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sfdx plugins:link .
# To verify
sfdx plugins
```

- [`sf org list snapshot`](#sf-org-list-snapshot)

## `sf org create shape`

Create a scratch org configuration (shape) based on the specified source org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org create shape -o <value> [--json] [--flags-dir <value>] [--api-version <value>]

FLAGS
  -o, --target-org=<value>   (required) Username or alias of the target org. Not required if the `target-org`
                             configuration variable is already set.
      --api-version=<value>  Override the api version used for api requests made by this command

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --flags-dir=<value>  Import flag values from a directory.
  --json               Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Create a scratch org configuration (shape) based on the specified source org.

  Scratch org shapes mimic the baseline setup (features, limits, edition, and Metadata API settings) of a source org
  without the extraneous data and metadata.

  Run "sf org list shape" to view the available org shapes and their IDs.

  To create a scratch org from an org shape, include the "sourceOrg" property in the scratch org definition file and set
  it to the org ID of the source org. Then create a scratch org with the "sf force:org:create" command.

ALIASES
  $ sf force org shape create

EXAMPLES
  Create an org shape for the source org with alias SourceOrg:

    $ sf org create shape --target-org SourceOrg
```

_See code: [src/commands/org/create/shape.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-signups/blob/2.2.5/src/commands/org/create/shape.ts)_

## `sf org create snapshot`

Create a snapshot of a scratch org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf org create snapshot -v <value> -o <value> -n <value> [--json] [--flags-dir <value>] [--api-version <value>] [-d
    <value>]

FLAGS
  -d, --description=<value>     Description of snapshot.
  -n, --name=<value>            (required) Unique name of snapshot.
  -o, --source-org=<value>      (required) ID or locally authenticated username or alias of scratch org to snapshot.
  -v, --target-dev-hub=<value>  (required) Username or alias of the Dev Hub org. Not required if the `target-dev-hub`
                                configuration variable is already set.
      --api-version=<value>     Override the api version used for api requests made by this command

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --flags-dir=<value>  Import flag values from a directory.
  --json               Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Create a snapshot of a scratch org.

  A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a scratch org. The copy is referenced by its unique name in a scratch org
  definition file.

  Use "sf org get snapshot" to get details, including status, about a snapshot creation request.

  To create a scratch org from a snapshot, include the "snapshot" option (instead of "edition") in the scratch org
  definition file and set it to the name of the snapshot. Then use "sf force:org:create" to create the scratch org.

ALIASES
  $ sf force org snapshot create

EXAMPLES
  Create a snapshot called "Dependencies" using the source scratch org ID and your default Dev Hub org:

    $ sf org create snapshot --source-org 00Dxx0000000000 --name Dependencies --description 'Contains PackageA \
      v1.1.0'

  Create a snapshot called "NightlyBranch" using the source scratch org username and a Dev Hub org with alias
  NightlyDevHub:

    $ sf org create snapshot --source-org myuser@myorg --name NightlyBranch --description 'Contains PkgA v2.1.0 and \
      PkgB 3.3.0' --target-dev-hub NightlyDevHub

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -d, --description=<value>  Description of snapshot.

    Use this description to document the contents of the snapshot. We suggest that you include a reference point, such
    as a version control system tag or commit ID.
```

_See code: [src/commands/org/create/snapshot.ts](https://github.com/salesforcecli/plugin-signups/blob/2.2.5/src/commands/org/create/snapshot.ts)_

## `sf org delete shape`

  A source org can have only one active org shape. If you try to create an org shape for a source org that already has
  one, the previous shape is marked inactive and replaced by a new active shape. If you donâ€™t want to create scratch
  orgs based on this shape, you can delete the org shape.

  snapshot".
